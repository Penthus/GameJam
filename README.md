# GameJam

My first game and GameJam. Had a lot of fun learning how things work, even though it's very rough code it was nice having a goal and trying to work towards it (even though I didn't complete what I wanted and had to change the scope of the game due to getting sick for the week.)

Some fairly simple bugs caused me a bit of time but I worked through them and got them working. Some very hacky solutions for some of my issues which aren't ideal but nothing appears too broken.

Wasn't able to complete the game over or death levelling up to tie it in with the theme as I ran out of time to learn about how to use game managers correctly to set those events. I managed to get one working enough so that I could set enemy spawn points and respawn them which was good.

Also had a play around learning pixel art and animations. Made a few textures and animations (Just colour editing existing sprites and mixing sprite orders around etc) and spent a lot of time working out how tilesheets worked, ended up cutting them up myself in GIMP and importing them to make it easier to  use for the enemies and characters due to the original having all different pixel sized art that I didn't know how to deal with.

Found a music track I liked and worked out how to get it into game, also added a swing SFX but wasn't able to get sounds for the enemies unfortunately.

Overall had a good time with the GameJam and looking forward to doing more in the future.
